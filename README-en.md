# ZipO-Mac

> ZipO-Mac can conveniently help you crack the password of the .zip compressed package on your Mac.

Need a password for files downloaded from the Internet?

Forgot the password set to protect the file?

These, ZipO-Mac can help you.

Before using this program, you may have used some other cracking programs.

They may not guarantee your privacy,

They may cause harm to your computer,

They may bring endless advertisements to your computer.

Is it annoying? I think so too.

So, I wrote this small program.

But there are still many areas that are not perfect, let us take it slowly.

Why choose ZipO-Mac?

- Use multithreading to quickly crack
- It can quickly and easily crack a pure digital password under 20 digits (no need to generate a codebook)
- Other passwords can be cracked through the codebook program

***

This is a very simple little program, so simple that it doesn't even have a GUI.

Before you start, you need to make some preparations.

- Download the latest **Release** package on GitHub or Gitee
- Modify the name of the cracked file to be `zipozip.zip`
